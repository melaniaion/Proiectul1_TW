            <h1>Coldplay in a few words</h1>
            <section class="paragraph">
            <p>From the time of British-bred sensation Coldplay's first major-label release in the summer
                of 2000,music journalists have written that the band doesn't quite fit in the current
                popular-music landscape.In spite of the ways in which they differ from their peers, 
                Coldplay has become a sensation, selling millions of records, earning numerous major awards,
                and garnering praise from music critics all over the world. The members of Coldplay met and 
                became friends while living in the same dormitory at the University College of London(UCL)
                in the mid-1990s.They formed a band, originally naming themselves Starfish. When friends  
                of theirs who were playing in a band called Coldplay no longer wanted to use the name, Starfish
                officially became Coldplay. The name was taken from a book of poetry called Child's Reflections, 
                <br>Cold Play.</p>

            <p><i>It is a challenge to bucket their musical style â€” it is rock, but not
            hard rock; it has got faint hints of blues, but is more romantic.
            That is the beauty of it, you can not put a label on them; their sound 
            is unique, soulful, healing & fills you up.</i>
